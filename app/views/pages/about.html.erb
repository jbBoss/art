        <h1>About The Exchange Print Co.</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome! We're The Exchange Print Co., a three-person art studio nestled in the heart of Winnipeg's historic Exchange District. Since our founding in 2015, we've been dedicated to creating high-quality, original digital art prints that celebrate the unique beauty of Manitoba and the prairies.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            For a decade, we've had the pleasure of connecting with our community and building a loyal local following. We got our start selling our art at bustling pop-up markets and local art fairs, growing our business through word-of-mouth and personal connections. After years of sharing our work face-to-face, we are excited to bring that same community spirit to our new online home.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Art</h2>
        <p>
            Our portfolio is a collection of original digital art prints inspired by the vast landscapes and resilient spirit of Manitoba and the Canadian prairies. Our mission is to provide unique, affordable art to design-conscious customers who want to bring a piece of the heartland into their homes. We also cater to interior designers and stagers seeking distinct digital assets for their projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each piece we sell is a high-resolution digital file, available for immediate download after purchase. This gives you the creative freedom to print and frame our art in a way that perfectly suits your space and personal style.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            This website was launched to expand our reach beyond local markets and make our art more accessible, both to our dedicated local followers and to new customers across the country. By moving online, we can streamline the sales process and, most importantly, share our passion for the prairies with a much wider audience.
